#### Introduction

Zombie Survival is simple shooter game written in Java. Your goal is to kill as many zombies as possible and survive for the longest time. As a player you can shoot zombies with three types of guns: pistol, bomb and laser. Every gun takes different amount of damage to zombies, has different reload time and has different  number of missiles. There are also three types of zombies in the game. There is a basic minion, which does not have any special abilities. Then there is a sprinter (green one), which moves quite fast, but takes less damage to the player. Finally there is a boss (red), which takes the biggest amount of damage to the player, but he is the slowest one.

#### Controls

You are controlling player's movement by these keys:

* A = Left
* W = Up
* S = Down
* D = Right

Shooting is controlled by mouse. You just have to point at right direction and press left button on the mouse. As a last functionality of game is gun switching, which is controlled by mouse wheel.
